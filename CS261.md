Choose Sommerville - Soft Eng



Meet up ASAP

- All departments
- Sighn up as mentors or mentees and matches based on preferences
- Will match and support the process
- Creates meetings, and plans of action

have a feedback mechanism

- About both people
- Diversity of services means there are many ranges of skilled professionals and a non-technical person

##### Rules of Mentoring

expected to follow a protocol, ensuring mentoring is followed

1. Mentee should always drive the relationship
2. Always  give time to the Mentee
3. Arrangement based on themes and topics they require help with
4. Should always be from a different business area to the mentee **key**

### Agile methodologies

a principle based off a set of methodologies

- Rapid software development
  - Specification, design and implementation are interleaved
  - System developed as a series of versions with stakeholders providing feedback at each stage

#### Motivating Agile Methods

- Software systems common to all businesses

  - Businesses need to adapt and evolve rapidly

- Process driven approaches become too cumbersome

  - Focus on the code as opposed to design

  - Aim is to deliver working code quickly in order to meet changing requirements

#### Principles of Agile

**Customer Involvement**

- Role of the customer is to provide and prioritise new system requirements and evaluate iterations of the system

**Incremental Delivery**

- The software developed in increments with the customer specifying the requirements for the next iteration

**People not process**

- The skills of the development team should be recognised. Team member should be lest to develop their own ways of working

**Embrace Change**

- Design a system that accommodates requirement change

**Maintain Simplicity**

- Focus on simplicity in the software being developed and the development process

- Lack of documentation - if someone new is needed, this can become a problem

#### Software Maintenance

- Most companies spend more money maintaining software than developing it - do agile methods support this
  - Agile focuses on development rather than documentation - could be difficult to pick up a system later on
  - Agile allows continual changes and refinements - makes adding features in the software evolution stage easier - if the original team is still there
- The original team is integral
  - More likely to get burnout, more intense, worse if people end up leaving the project

#### Plan and Agile Dev

- Plan driven approaches have aspecific stages with outputs from one stage feeding the inputs to the next

#### Extreme Programming 

Incremental delivery with fast iterations

- Versions built several times a day
- Delivered to customers every two weeks
- Automated tests to verify builds - build only accepted if all tests pass
- Code continually refactored to maintain simplicity
- Strong customer involvement

- Incremental planning
  - Requirements recorded on story cards, stories to be included in the next release are selected based off priority
- Small releases
  - Initially, minimum set of functionality developed
  - Following releases add new functionality
- Simple Design
  - Only enough design performed to meet current requirements
- Test driven dev
  - Tests are written before the software, software then evaluated using them

- Refactoring
  -  Developers are expected to continually refactor and improve code
- Pair programming
  - Developers work in pairs, checking each others work and providing support - one codes, the other watches
- Collective ownership
  - At least 2 developers have responsibility for any part of the code, any developer can work on any part of the system if they want to make a change.
- Continuous integration
  - Components integrated as soon as they are ready.
- Sustainable Pace
  - Large amounts of overtime is avoided, programming occurs at a sensible pace with support to complete the job well
- On-site Customer
  - Customer always available to work with the team
  - No waiting for response to emails

#### Scrum

- General agile method that focuses on managing iterative development rather than specific agile process

**£ stages**

- Outline planning phase - establish general goals
- Sprint cycles - each cycle develops an increment of the system
- Project closure - wrap up the project, documents and delivers

##### Sprints

Typically development cycles

- Typically 2-4 weeks
- Daily team meeting to discuss current work
- Each sprint completes item on the backlog
- Features selected with the customer, than isolated from the customer for the remainder of the cycle
- Scrum master interfaces between team and customer
- Each cycle reviewed and presented
