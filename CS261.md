Meet up ASAP

- All departments
- Sighn up as mentors or mentees and matches based on preferences
- Will match and support the process
- Creates meetings, and plans of action

have a feedback mechanism

- About both people
- Diversity of services means there are many ranges of skilled professionals and a non-technical person

##### Rules of Mentoring

expected to follow a protocol, ensuring mentoring is followed

1. Mentee should always drive the relationship
2. Always  give time to the Mentee
3. Arrangement based on themes and topics they require help with
4. Should always be from a different business area to the mentee **key**

### Agile methodologies

a principle based off a set of methodologies

- Rapid software development
  - Specification, design and implementation are interleaved
  - System developed as a series of versions with stakeholders providing feedback at each stage

#### Motivating Agile Methods

- Software systems common to all businesses

  - Businesses need to adapt and evolve rapidly

- Process driven approaches become too cumbersome

  - Focus on the code as opposed to design

  - Aim is to deliver working code quickly in order to meet changing requirements

#### Principles of Agile

**Customer Involvement**

- Role of the customer is to provide and prioritise new system requirements and evaluate iterations of the system

**Incremental Delivery**

- The software developed in increments with the customer specifying the requirements for the next iteration

**People not process**

- The skills of the development team should be recognised. Team member should be lest to develop their own ways of working

**Embrace Change**

- Design a system that accommodates requirement change

**Maintain Simplicity**

- Focus on simplicity in the software being developed and the development process

- Lack of documentation - if someone new is needed, this can become a problem

#### Software Maintenance

- Most companies spend more money maintaining software than developing it - do agile methods support this
  - Agile focuses on development rather than documentation - could be difficult to pick up a system later on
  - Agile allows continual changes and refinements - makes adding features in the software evolution stage easier - if the original team is still there
- The original team is integral
  - More likely to get burnout, more intense, worse if people end up leaving the project

#### Plan and Agile Dev

- Plan driven approaches have aspecific stages with outputs from one stage feeding the inputs to the next

#### Extreme Programming 

Incremental delivery with fast iterations

- Versions built several times a day
- Delivered to customers every two weeks
- Automated tests to verify builds - build only accepted if all tests pass
- Code continually refactored to maintain simplicity
- Strong customer involvement

- Incremental planning
  - Requirements recorded on story cards, stories to be included in the next release are selected based off priority
- Small releases
  - Initially, minimum set of functionality developed
  - Following releases add new functionality
- Simple Design
  - Only enough design performed to meet current requirements
- Test driven dev
  - Tests are written before the software, software then evaluated using them

- Refactoring
  -  Developers are expected to continually refactor and improve code
- Pair programming
  - Developers work in pairs, checking each others work and providing support - one codes, the other watches
- Collective ownership
  - At least 2 developers have responsibility for any part of the code, any developer can work on any part of the system if they want to make a change.
- Continuous integration
  - Components integrated as soon as they are ready.
- Sustainable Pace
  - Large amounts of overtime is avoided, programming occurs at a sensible pace with support to complete the job well
- On-site Customer
  - Customer always available to work with the team
  - No waiting for response to emails

#### Scrum

- General agile method that focuses on managing iterative development rather than specific agile process

**£ stages**

- Outline planning phase - establish general goals
- Sprint cycles - each cycle develops an increment of the system
- Project closure - wrap up the project, documents and delivers

##### Sprints

Typically development cycles

- Typically 2-4 weeks
- Daily team meeting to discuss current work
- Each sprint completes item on the backlog
- Features selected with the customer, than isolated from the customer for the remainder of the cycle
- Scrum master interfaces between team and customer
- Each cycle reviewed and presented

### Requirements Analysis

Requirements are descriptions of what the system should do, the services it provides and the constraints on its operation.

- enable the developers to make software that will correctly fulfil the customer's needs
- Provide a basis for tests, validation and verification
- Enable accurate cost estimation (allegedly)

#### What are requirements

Distinguish what is build from how it should be built

- How should come much later in the life cycle with plan



Requirements are a bridge between customers and developers

- Documentation should be developed to support both
- Establish a contract between the customer and the developer

#### C and D requirements

Customer Facing:

- Requirements for the customer
- This comes first

Developer Facing:

- Requirements for the developer to create this requirement

This is all still one requirement, with two separate aspect

Requirements must be unambiguous

##### User Requirements

- Define how the system should work from a user's point of view
- Described in natural language with diagrams
- List of constraints from the user's point of view

##### Developer Requirements

- Detailed descriptions fo the functions, services, and operation constraints
- Defines exactly what must be designed and implemented act as a bases for the contract with the developer

#### Writing Requirments

- Prioritised
  - Assign an implementation priority to each requirement, feature, or use case to indicate how essential it is to include it in a particular product release. Customers or their surrogates have the lion’s share of the responsibility for establishing priorities.
- Consistent
  - Consistent requirements do not conflict with other software requirements or with higher level (system or business) requirements

- Modifiable
  - You must be able to revise the set of requriements when necessary 
- Traceable
  -  Should be able to link each software requirement to its source, which could be a higher level system req. a use case, a voice of the customer statement. Link each to the design elements, source code, and test cases
- Correct
  - Each requirement accurately describes the functionality. And the customers POV
- Feasible
  - Must be possible to implement each requirement within the known capabilities and limitations of the system
- Necessary
  - each requirement should document something the customers really need, or requuired for conformance to an external requirement or an external interface or standard
- Unambiguous
  - Multiple readers of a requirement should arrive at the same interpretation
- Verifiable
  - See whether you can derive tests or use other verification approaches such as inspection or demonstration to determine whether each requirement is properly implemented in the product

#### MoSCoW requirements

- Must 
- Should 
- Could
- Won't

#### General Points

Use:

- Customer
  - Ensure the requirements are met
- Managers
  - To bid for and plan the system
- Engineers
  - A guide to implement the system
- Testers
  - To design the test cases based on the requirements
- Maintainers
  - To understand the relationship between components once the system has been completed

#### Requirements Elicitation And Analysis

**Discovery**

- Stakeholder - anyone who has some influence on the system requirements

- Gathers information about the project and convert into requirements
  - Interviews, domain research
- Conflicting Requirements, imprecise information, legal/ organisational factors

**Requirements Classification and Organisation**

- Categorises the discovered requirements to groupo similar ones, or similar themes

**Prioritisation and Negotiation**

- Prioritise the requirements and negotiate between requirements from different stakeholders

**Specification**

- Place the requirements in a document for stakeholders to read, then begin the process again as new requirements are discovered and old ones changed



**Checks**

Validity - will the system support the customer’s needs? • 

Consistency - are there any conflicts? •

 Realism - can the system be produced with the available budget and technologies? • 

Verifiability - once complete, can the system be shown to satisfy the requirements?

#### Validation

#### PM Lifetime

##### Initiation

The process of defining the project, objectives, scope, purpose and deliverables. This is mostly the responsibility of the PM.

- Understand the Business Goals (PM/BA)

  - Identify business needs, problems or opportunities. Justify the investment necessary to deliver solution. Provides a clear vision of the project, and makes it easier to gain approval. Could take the form of a business case.

- Plan the project (PM)

  - Breakdown into manageable pieces of work, ensuring clear definition of responsibilities and dependencies

  - Allows for the project to have a clear structured approach
    - Could take form of a product  initiation Document

- Governance (PM)

  - Process and procedures that will support the management decision making
  - Enables efficient delivery and accountability

- Quality management (PM)

  - Standards, processes and procedures to ensure fit for purpose deliverables
  - Have to ensure processes are consistent, predictable and repeatable

  - Quality gates for example

- Risk and issues (PM)

  - Managing risks and issues to stop them from preventing progress
  - Improves pro-activism. May include the creation of a risk and issue log

##### Project Initiation Document

Contain everything needed to run the project

- provides reference point throughout the project so can be tracked
- The aim of creating a PID is to understand the outcomes of the project, both immediate and longer term.
- The aim of creating a PID is to understand the outcomes of the project, both immediate and longer term.

##### Analysis

The tasks and techniques used to work as a liaison among stakeholders in order to understand the structure, policies and operations of an organisation, and recommend solutions the enable the organisation to achieve its goals.

- Plan Analysis Approach (BA)
