# CS259 Formal Languages

- Intro to the theory of computation
- Automata Theory, Languages, Computation


## What is a language:

An alphabet - a non-empty finite set of symbols:
$\sum_1=\{a,b,c\}$ 

The symbols are arbitrary:

A **language** is a (potentially infinite) set of finite strings over an alphabet

$\sum^*\{$ All finite strings (WORDS) over the alphabet$\sum\}$ 

Sigma star denote

### What do Languages have to do with CS

- Every decision problem can be phrased in the form “is a given string present in the language L”

Does the graph have an independent set of size 100?

- The binary encoding of the given graph present in the language L = \{all binary strings encoding graphs with an IS of size 100\} 

### Deterministic Finite Automation

- Finite set of STATES - L
- Finite set called the ALPHABET - $\Sigma$
- In which state to tart the computation - $q_0\in Q$
- Where are the FINAL/accepting States $F\subseteq Q$
- How to transition from one state  to another: $\delta:Q\cross \Sigma \rightarrow Q$

#### Formal Definition

A machine $M$ defined by the tuple $M=(Q,\Sigma,q_0,F,\delta)$

- $q_0$ is the only state that the state can start in, the self accepting states are those with a self loop
- If in q2, no matter what, you return to q2, the same with q3

The additional circle denotes which of the states is a finite state

- Sometimes a machine can be created where it is not possible to reach the final state
- The symbol denotes the direction of the 
- At every state, there must be a result for every given value of the alphabet
  - This is because this is function rather than a partial function

- At the final states add a star
  - In this example, technically all examples could be a final state 

- $\epsilon$ represents the empty string

| Input      | Output |
| ---------- | ------ |
| a          | Accept |
| aa         | Accept |
| abcbc      | Reject |
| bcabc      | Reject |
| $\epsilon$ | Reject |





#### Outcomes

- Create the state transition table for a DFA
- Give an accept or reject for a string
- Give the set of strings that would be accepted
  - In the shown example, any string of length $\leq 1$ consisting only of $a$‘s’
