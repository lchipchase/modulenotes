# CS254 Algorithmic Graph Theory

## Week 1



Key points

- understanding basic properties of graphics and design efficient algorithms
- Deisigning efficient algorithms fo graph problems
- Analysing algorithms and proving correctness

Motivated typically by IT/CS



Running and correctness to determine the quality of the algorithms

### Introduction

#### Basic definitions

Graph definitions (according to module)

Graph:

- A pair of vertices and edges $G=(V,E)$
  - V are vertices / nodes
  - E are pairwise relations of elements of V

- Undir graph $G=(V,E)$
  - V are vertices
  - E are edges - a set of sets of pairs of edges

- di Graphs - simple
  - V a set of vertices
  - $E\subseteq V \cross V$ edges, where E is non - reflexive
- Undir multigraph - pseudograph
  - A set of V vertices
  - A multi set E of edges that consist of two-element multi-sets over elements V
