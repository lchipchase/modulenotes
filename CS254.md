### Introduction

#### Basic definitions

Graph definitions (according to module)

Graph:

- A pair of vertices and edges $G=(V,E)$
  - V are vertices / nodes
  - E are pairwise relations of elements of V
- Undir graph $G=(V,E)$  (typically this is the type which will be looked at)
  - V are vertices
  - E are edges - a set of sets of pairs of edges
- di Graphs - simple
  - V a set of vertices
  - $E\subseteq V \cross V$ edges, where E is non - reflexive
- Undir multigraph - pseudograph
  - A set of V vertices
  - A multi set E of edges that consist of two-element multi-sets over elements V
- Directed multigraph
  - The same as a digraph, but allows multiple elements
  - $E\subseteq V\cross V$ -
    - Terminology - sometimes an edge is an arc
- Order of a graph
  - The cardinality of the vertex set, usually use $n$ to denote $|V|$
- The size of a graph is the cardinality $|E$| of its edge set
- A graph that does not contain , multi edges or self loop is called simple

- An edge $e$ is incident to a vertex $v$ if:
  - $v\in e$ for undirected graphs
  - $e=(v,x)$ or $e-(v,x)$ with $x\in V$ 
- The two vertices an edge e is incident to are called the end points of e
- Two vertices u and v are adjacent if there is an edge e that is inciden to both of them
- Two edges are called adjacent if they share some commone vertex
- For a digraph, $u$ is called the tail and v s called the head
- The degree is the number of edges incident to it
  - Self loop is counted twice
- Inand out degreee in a digraph
- $deg(vv) = indeg(v) + outdeg(v)$
- $\sum_{v\in V} deg(v)=2E$

- $\Delta$ is denoted for the maximum degree of a graph
- A sequence is called a path if:
  - $\forall i \in \{1,…,k-1\}:\{v_j, v_{i + 1}\}\in E$
- The length is the number of its edges
- A path is called a cycle if it has the same start and end point
- Is simple if al; vertices are distinct
- A cycle is simple if the vertices are distinct  - bar the start and finish
- A cycle of odd(even) length is called an odd(even) cycle

Graph connection

- Call a undir graph G connected if there exists a u,v path for ever pair of vertices u and v
- We call a digraph G connected if for ever pair for vertices u,v there exists either a u v path or a  v u path
- Call a digraph strongly connected if for every pair of vertices u,v there exists a u,v path and a v, u path

Subgraph terminology

- A subgraph if the edges and nodes are a subset of the original graphs
- Induced subgraph of $G$ if it is a subgraph of $G$ and $E’$ contains all edges of $E$ with end points in $V’$ 
- A subgraph of $G’=(V’,E)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is called spanning if $V’ = V$

- undir graph that does not contain a cycle as a subgraph is a forest
- An undir graph, connected graph that does not contain a cycle as a subgraph is called a tree
- A spanning subgraph of a graph $G$ that is a tree called a spanning tree of $G$

DAG

- a directed graph that does not contain a cycle is called a DAG
- Has a maximum of $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ 
- $V=\{1,…,n\}$
- $E=\{(i,j), i <j\}$

Bipartite graphs

- An undir graph $G=(V,E)$ is called bipartite if the set $V$ can be decomposed into subset $V_1,V_2$ such that
- $V=V_1\uplus V_2$

### Testing Bipartiteness

Is there a partition of $V$ into two set $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that $V_1,V_2$ are independent sets

- WLOG add the first node into $V_1$ 

Use a two colouring 

- The second must be in $V_1$

#### Corollary

A graph that contains an odd cycle is not bipartite

- A graph is not bipartite iff G contains an odd cycle



### BFS and Bipartiteness

P1 - Edges not contains in the BFS tree can only connect successive layers or may connect nodes on the same layer

P2 - The BFS tree contains a shortest (s,v) path for every node v reachable from s

- Run  BFS and analyse the structure of the explored graphs
- Consider only connected graphs

**Lemma**

G is bipartite iff there is no edge u,v with u and v on the same level in the BFS tree

A graph is bipartite iff it does not contain an odd length cycle

**P2 Shortest path property**

- The nodes are added to the BFS tree in non-decreasing order of distance to s

- By the prooof above, we know that nodes are added to T in non-decreasing order
- Proof by cont:
  - Assume that v is the node closest to s in G for which no shortes s,v path is contained in T]
- Let u denote the predecessor of v in some shortes s,v path and let x denote the predecessor of v in T
- Then some shortest s,u path will be contained in 

**P1 Proof**

- $\{u,v\}\in E$ so that u is on layer l, v is at layer l'. $l<l' - 1$
- $dist(s,v) = l' - 1, dist(s,u) = l$
  - $l + 1 \geq l'$
  - Contradiction
