# CS262 Logic And Verification

## What is logic

- Study of correct reasoning
- Mathematical logic - captures reasoning in a fully formal system
- Four pillars of logic:
  - Set theory
  - Model theory
  - Proof theory
  - Recursion theory

### Politicians fallacy

- Improve things, changes must be made
- Policy is to change things
- Therefore improving things

### Induction and Recursion

**Induction**

- Build a bigger structure from its constituents /technique

**Example**

- Variables x,y,z
- sums/product of terms

**Theorem**

- Number of opening parenthesis = number of closing

Recursion - Decompose a bigger structure into its constituents / programming technique

```
f(x) = 0
f((X+Y)) = f(X) + f(Y) + 2
f((X*Y)) = f(X) + f(Y) + 2
```

### Syntax and Semantics



**Syntax**

- Formal specification of a language - often by induction

**Example**

- Arithmetic
  - $1,s(1),s(s(1)),+/\cross$

**Semantics**

- Meaning of the formal symbols in a particular context
  - Domain of variables/quantifiers (natural numbers)
  - Formal language needs interpretation in a particular model
  - Truth/falseness depends on the model

The combination of the two concepts gives full meaning and definition to a language, which then can be used if statements given are true or false

## Lecture 2 - Basics of prop logic

A formal system for reasoning about propositions

- Proposition = Formula = Statement

### Atomic vs compound propositions

Atomic:

- The simplest possible proposition, and cannot be broken down

Compound:

- Propositions joined by other words

It is the form of the argument that matters rather than the meaning of the sentences

- The words if it is raining, or if I get full marks are arbitrary

### Propositional Language

Atomic formulas - the most basic propositions

$p=$ it is raining

Logical connectives/operators allow the building of more complicated propositions

- $¬$ negation - it is not raining
- $\wedge$ and it is raining and I take my umbrella
- $\or$ or It is raining or i take my umbrella
- $\rightarrow$ implies If it is raining then I take my umbrella

$\circ\in\{\and,\or,\rightarrow,..\}$

#### Syntax of propositional formulas

**Prop formulas**

- Are exactly those that can be constructed by a finite number of applications of the following rules
  - Propositional variables, p,q,r and $\top$ and $\bot$ are atomic formulas
  - If $X$ is a formula, so is $¬X$
  - If $X,Y$ are formulas then so is $(X\circ Y)$ where $\circ$ is any binary connective

**Conventions**

May leave out brackets where there is no ambiguity

## Parse Tree

- A recursive definition of a subtree

- There is a distinction between left and right child,
  - With binary connectives, such as implication

### Induction and Recursion

- We can define recursive functions on formulas

- Where deg(A) = 0 is the base case of the formula
- The negation adds 1
- The combination, adds 1, then the degrees of the two sub formulas

#### **Theorem**

- The degree of a formula equals the number of inner nodes of the parse tree

**Proof**

A proof of induction over the structures

- typically over numbers, however works on any inductively defined stucture

**Base Case**

Atomic Formula: $x$

- These are leaves in the parse tree
- Contribute nothing (0) to the number of inner nodes

$deg(x)$ = 0

**Induction Step:**

- There are two ways of defining propositional formulas:
  - Negation
  - Binary connective

1. $¬$

- Having a negation, means that there is a variable or a formula being negated, hence this increases the number of inner nodes:
- $deg(¬x)=deg(x)+1$, - The degree of $¬X$ = $deg(X)+1$

2. $\circ$ 

There is a subtree with binary connectives:

- $deg(X\circ Y) = 1+deg(X)+deg(Y)$

- This means that $\circ$ is an inner node, which generates the plus one:
  - Since the number of inner nodes of each are the same, then the proof is concluded:

$\square$

- T,F or 0,1

#### Truth table connectives

The nullary connectives are what always gives you true or false

$X\rightarrow Y$

- The first is the premise, and the second the conclusion

- $\downarrow$ - nand
- $\uparrow$ - nor



#### Valuations

This is a mapping V from the set of propositional formulas to the set of truth values $\{T,F\}$ satisfying the conditions:

- To examine all interesting valuations for a given formula, it is enough to specify v for each varible. The value of all sub formulas can be deduced bottom up (in the parse tree)

- A truth table specifies all valuations

#### Tautologies, contradictions

- A formua evaluates to $T$ under all valuations is called a tautology
- A formula that evaluates to $F$ under all valuations is called a contradiction
- A formula that evaluates to $T$ for some is called satisfiable
