# CS262 Logic And Verification

## What is logic

- Study of correct reasoning
- Mathematical logic - captures reasoning in a fully formal system
- Four pillars of logic:
  - Set theory
  - Model theory
  - Proof theory
  - Recursion theory

### Politicians fallacy

- Improve things, changes must be made
- Policy is to change things
- Therefore improving things

### Induction and Recursion

**Induction**

- Build a bigger structure from its constituents /technique

**Example**

- Variables x,y,z
- sums/product of terms

**Theorem**

- Number of opening parenthesis = number of closing

Recursion - Decompose a bigger structure into its constituents / programming technique

```
f(x) = 0
f((X+Y)) = f(X) + f(Y) + 2
f((X*Y)) = f(X) + f(Y) + 2
```

### Syntax and Semantics



**Syntax**

- Formal specification of a language - often by induction

**Example**

- Arithmetic
  - $1,s(1),s(s(1)),+/\cross$

**Semantics**

- Meaning of the formal symbols in a particular context
  - Domain of variables/quantifiers (natural numbers)
  - Formal language needs interpretation in a particular model
  - Truth/falseness depends on the model

The combination of the two concepts gives full meaning and definition to a language, which then can be used if statements given are true or false

## Lecture 2 - Basics of prop logic

A formal system for reasoning about propositions

- Proposition = Formula = Statement

### Atomic vs compound propositions

Atomic:

- The simplest possible proposition, and cannot be broken down

Compound:

- Propositions joined by other words

It is the form of the argument that matters rather than the meaning of the sentences

- The words if it is raining, or if I get full marks are arbitrary

### Propositional Language

Atomic formulas - the most basic propositions

$p=$ it is raining

Logical connectives/operators allow the building of more complicated propositions

- $¬$ negation - it is not raining
- $\wedge$ and it is raining and I take my umbrella
- $\or$ or It is raining or i take my umbrella
- $\rightarrow$ implies If it is raining then I take my umbrella

$\circ\in\{\and,\or,\rightarrow,..\}$

#### Syntax of propositional formulas

**Prop formulas**

- Are exactly those that can be constructed by a finite number of applications of the following rules
  - Propositional variables, p,q,r and $\top$ and $\bot$ are atomic formulas
  - If $X$ is a formula, so is $¬X$
  - If $X,Y$ are formulas then so is $(X\circ Y)$ where $\circ$ is any binary connective

**Conventions**

May leave out brackets where there is no ambiguity
