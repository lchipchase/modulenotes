# CS262 Logic And Verification

# What is logic

- Study of correct reasoning
- Mathematical logic - captures reasoning in a fully formal system
- Four pillars of logic:
  - Set theory
  - Model theory
  - Proof theory
  - Recursion theory

## Politicians fallacy

- Improve things, changes must be made
- Policy is to change things
- Therefore improving things

## Induction and Recursion

**Induction**

- Build a bigger structure from its constituents /technique

**Example**

- Variables x,y,z
- sums/product of terms

**Theorem**

- Number of opening parenthesis = number of closing

Recursion - Decompose a bigger structure into its constituents / programming technique

```
f(x) = 0
f((X+Y)) = f(X) + f(Y) + 2
f((X*Y)) = f(X) + f(Y) + 2
```

## Syntax and Semantics



**Syntax**

- Formal specification of a language - often by induction

**Example**

- Arithmetic
  - $1,s(1),s(s(1)),+/\cross$

**Semantics**

- Meaning of the formal symbols in a particular context
  - Domain of variables/quantifiers (natural numbers)
  - Formal language needs interpretation in a particular model
  - Truth/falseness depends on the model

The combination of the two concepts gives full meaning and definition to a language, which then can be used if statements given are true or false

# Lecture 2 - Basics of prop logic

A formal system for reasoning about propositions

- Proposition = Formula = Statement

## Atomic vs compound propositions

Atomic:

- The simplest possible proposition, and cannot be broken down

Compound:

- Propositions joined by other words

It is the form of the argument that matters rather than the meaning of the sentences

- The words if it is raining, or if I get full marks are arbitrary

## Propositional Language

Atomic formulas - the most basic propositions

$p=$ it is raining

Logical connectives/operators allow the building of more complicated propositions

- $¬$ negation - it is not raining
- $\wedge$ and it is raining and I take my umbrella
- $\or$ or It is raining or i take my umbrella
- $\rightarrow$ implies If it is raining then I take my umbrella

$\circ\in\{\and,\or,\rightarrow,..\}$

## Syntax of propositional formulas

**Prop formulas**

- Are exactly those that can be constructed by a finite number of applications of the following rules
  - Propositional variables, p,q,r and $\top$ and $\bot$ are atomic formulas
  - If $X$ is a formula, so is $¬X$
  - If $X,Y$ are formulas then so is $(X\circ Y)$ where $\circ$ is any binary connective

**Conventions**

May leave out brackets where there is no ambiguity

## Parse Tree

![image-20220112111751753](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220112111751753.png)

- A recursive definition of a subtree

- There is a distinction between left and right child,
  - With binary connectives, such as implication

### Induction and Recursion

- We can define recursive functions on formulas

![image-20220112111947438](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220112111947438.png)

- Where deg(A) = 0 is the base case of the formula
- The negation adds 1
- The combination, adds 1, then the degrees of the two sub formulas

#### **Theorem**

- The degree of a formula equals the number of inner nodes of the parse tree

**Proof**

A proof of induction over the structures

- typically over numbers, however works on any inductively defined stucture

**Base Case**

Atomic Formula: $x$

- These are leaves in the parse tree
- Contribute nothing (0) to the number of inner nodes

$deg(x)$ = 0

**Induction Step:**

- There are two ways of defining propositional formulas:
  - Negation
  - Binary connective

1. $¬$

- Having a negation, means that there is a variable or a formula being negated, hence this increases the number of inner nodes:
- $deg(¬x)=deg(x)+1$, - The degree of $¬X$ = $deg(X)+1$

2. $\circ$ 

There is a subtree with binary connectives:

- $deg(X\circ Y) = 1+deg(X)+deg(Y)$

- This means that $\circ$ is an inner node, which generates the plus one:
  - Since the number of inner nodes of each are the same, then the proof is concluded:

$\square$

## Semantics of Propositional Logic

![image-20220112113505902](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220112113505902.png)

- T,F or 0,1

### Truth table connectives

![image-20220112113739849](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220112113739849.png)

The nullary connectives are what always gives you true or false

$X\rightarrow Y$

- The first is the premise, and the second the conclusion

- $\downarrow$ - nand
- $\uparrow$ - nor



### Valuations

This is a mapping V from the set of propositional formulas to the set of truth values $\{T,F\}$ satisfying the conditions:

![image-20220112114542917](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220112114542917.png)

- To examine all interesting valuations for a given formula, it is enough to specify v for each varible. The value of all sub formulas can be deduced bottom up (in the parse tree)

- A truth table specifies all valuations

### Tautologies, contradictions

- A formula evaluates to $T$ under all valuations is called a tautology
- A formula that evaluates to $F$ under all valuations is called a contradiction
- A formula that evaluates to $T$ for some is called satisfiable



## Complete Set of Connectives

- Said to be complete if we can represent every truth function: $\{T,F\}\rightarrow\{T,F\}$ using only these connectives
  - $2^{2^n}$ such functions

| p     | f1   | f2   | f3   | f4   |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **T** | T    | T    | F    | F    |
| **F** | T    | F    | T    | F    |

- f1 = T
- f2 = $p$
- f3  = $¬p$
- f4 = $\bot$ 

### Proof By Construction

To create a formula that is given is logically equivalent to any function $f$ on variables $x_1,...,x_n$ given by its truth table.

![image-20220118131810143](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220118131810143.png)

- This is the disjunctive normal form of f

- A  formula in DNF is a disjunction of conjunctions of literals. A literal is a variable or its negation or $\top,\bot$
- A formula in CNF is a conjunction of disjunctions of literals

### Normal Form Algorithms

- Deriving DNF or CNF in systematic ways

### Generalized Disjunctions/conjunctions

Let $X_1,...,X_n$ be a sequence of propositional formulas

Generalised disjunction as:

- $[X_1,...,X_n] = X_1\or ...\or X_n$ - associativity

Generalised Conjunction as

-  $\langle X_1,...,X_n\rangle=X_1\and...\and X_n$

If these variables are literals, then $[X_1,...,X_n]$ is a clause, else it is a dual clause

**Literal** is a variable, its negation or a nullary operator 

### Valuations on generalised disjunctions

![image-20220118134910248](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220118134910248.png)

### $\alpha \beta $ formulas

- All proposotional formulas of the forms $(X\circ Y)$ and $¬(X\circ Y)$ where $\circ$ is one of the binary connectives intwo two categories, those that act conjunctively and those that act disjunctively

![image-20220119111150121](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220119111150121.png)



![image-20220119112315346](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220119112315346.png)



### CJNF Algorithm

- Given any propositional formula, start take X, and create a conjunction of disjunctions $\langle[X]\rangle$
- Look somewhere inside for the square brackets

![image-20220119112402718](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220119112402718.png)



#### Compact Form

- Top row is what we have, bottom is what we do

![`](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220119115100801.png)

#### Proof of Correctness

The algorithm produces a sequence of logically equivalent formula

![image-20220119115327950](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220119115327950.png)

#### Termination of the Algorithm

- The algorithm terminates regardless of which choices are made during the algorithm

- Consider a rooted tree. A branch is a sequence of nodes starting at the root, descending towards one of the children in each step (unless no children are present). We say that the tree is finitely branching, if every node has only finitely many children (possibly 0). A tree/branch is finite if it has a finite number of nodes; otherwise it is infinite.

**A tree that is finitely branching, but infinite, must have an infinite branch**

##### A game with balls

Consider the following game played with balls that have non negative integer values

- At the beginning, have a box with just one ball
- At the beginning, we have a box containing just one vall
- In each step, we can remove one ball from the box, and replace it by any finite number of balls having lower numbers

The game must end, regardless of which choices are made during the game

To prove the termination of the algorithm, define a rank of the propositional formulas as follows:

Recursion anchor: $r(p)=r(¬p)=0$ for all variables $p:r(\top)=r(\bot)=0$

- $r(¬\top)=r(¬\bot)=1$

Recursive Step: $r(¬¬Z)=r(Z)+1$

$r(\alpha)=r(\alpha_1)+r(\alpha_2) + 1;r(\beta)=r(\beta_1)+r(\beta_2)+1$

![image-20220120163826343](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220120163826343.png)

![image-20220120164604563](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220120164604563.png)

![image-20220120165430102](C:\Users\leonc\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220120165430102.png)

# Semantic Tableau and Resolution

- Two proof procedures for propositional logic, emantic tableu and resolution

Semantic tableau: closely connected to disjunctive normal form

Resolution - closely connected to conjunctive normal form

Both systems well suited for  automation

- Assignment, implement a resolution theoram prover in Prolog

Both are refutation systems: to prove a formula X is a tautology, begin with ¬X and form a contradiction

## Semantic Tableau

Proof takes form of a tree, with nodes labelled by propositional formulas

![image-20220125132200230](C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220125132200230.png) 

Each branch as a conjunction of the formulas on that branch, and the tree as the disjunction of all of its branches - DNF

### Tableau Expression

In each step, select a branch and a non literal formula N on that branch

- If $N=¬\top$, then extend the branch by a node labelled $\bot$ at its end
- If $N=¬\bot$ then extend the branch by a node labelled $\top$ at its end
- If $N=¬¬Z$ then extend the branch by a node labelled $Z$ at its end

- If $N$ is an $\alpha$ formula, then extend the branch by two nodes labelled $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ ($\alpha$ expansion)
- If $N$ is a $\beta$ formulaa, then add a left and right child to the final node of the branch, and label one of them $\beta_1$ and the other $\beta_2$ - $\beta$ expansion

![image-20220125133501912](C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220125133501912.png)



### Closed Tableau

A branch of a tableau is closed, if both X and ¬X occur on the branch for some formula X or if $\bot$ occurs on the branch

If x and ¬x appear on a branch where x is a variable, or if $\bot$ appears, then the branch is automatically closed

A tableau is (atomically) closed, if every branch is (atomically) closed

A tableau proof of X is a closed tableau for $¬X$

Write $\vdash_t X$ if X has a tableau proof 







### Tableau Properties

- Can be very short compared to truth tables.

  - $X\or ¬X$ for a complicated formula X
  - This instantly creates a negation
  - Extends to first order logic - quantifiers
  - Tableau can be generalised to establish propositional consequences $S\models X$, not just Tautologies $\models X$

  - The rules are non-deterministic

### Implementation

- Reuse of formulas, how do we know when to give up on a proof attempt. Try again something we have tried before - they don't prohibit expansion twice
- A tableau is strict if no formula has had an expansion rule applied to it on the **same branch**
- Represent the tree as a list of lists - disjunction of conjunctions: Strictness rule allows us to remove an expanded formula from the list
- Could run DNS expansion algorithm and check for closure in the end
  - Every branch is a conjunction of literals - in CNF - possibly less efficient
- Do not need to expand completely before checking for closure
- Proof can be shortened to effectively check the expansion rule
- Considerable necessity for heuristics

### Theorem:

The tableau proof system is sound:

- If X has a tableau proof, then X is a tautology

The tableau proof system is complete:

- If X is a tautology, then the strict tableau system will terminate with a proof for it

First theorem follows from the correctness proof of our DNF expansion algorithm given before: Every expansion step produces a logically equivalent formula

## Resolution

Tableau Proofs $\leftrightarrow$ DNF

Resolution $\leftrightarrow$ CNF

- Tableau represented as trees, each branch is a conjunction tree is the disjunction of its branches
- Trees are not conventient for resolution. Use the standard representation, $\langle[][][][]\rangle$ 

<img src="C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220201131240259.png" alt="image-20220201131240259" style="zoom:33%;" />



### Strict Resolution

A sequence of resolution expansion applications is strict, if every disjunction has at most one resolution expansion rule applied to it. Intuitively: no formula reuse As with tableau, strict version suits itself for implementation: Remove formula from list after applying an expansion rule to it. With this, resolution expansion becomes identical to conjunctive normal form expansion

### Resolution Rule

Suppose D1 and D2 are two conjunctions with X occuring in D1 and ¬X in D2. Let D be the result of the following:

- Delete all occurrences of X in D1
- Delete all occurrences of ¬X from D2
- Combine the resulting disjunctions

Special Case:

- If a disjunction contains $\bot$ delete all occurrences of $\bot$ and call the resulting disjunction the trivial resolvent.



D is the result of D1 and D2 on X. D is the resolvent of D1 and D2, and X is the formula being resolved on. If X is atomic, then this is an atomic application of the resolution rule.



### Resolution Proof

A resolution expansion is closed, if it contains the empty clause.

A resolution proof for X is a closed resolution for ¬X

We write $\vdash_rX$ if X has a resolution proof.

<img src="C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220201132947790.png" alt="image-20220201132947790" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Soundness of Resolution

The system is sound. If X has a resolution proof, then X isa tauology

- The resolution system is also complete

- If X is a tautology, then the resolution system will terminate with a proof for it, even if all resolution rule applications are atomic or trivial and come after all resolution steps

### Propositional Consequence

- $S\models X$
- S indoruction rule for tableau:
  - Any formula $Y\in S$ can be added to the end of any tableau branch. We write $S\vdash_tX$ if there is a closed tableau for $¬X$ allowing the S introduction rule for tableau
- For Resolution
  - Any formula $Y\in S$, the line $[Y]$ can be added as a line to a resolution expansion. We Write $S\vdash_rX$ if there is a closed resolution expansion for $¬X$ allowing the S introduction rule for resolution

![image-20220203161341333](C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220203161341333.png)







# Natural Deduction

Formalises the kind of reasoning people do in informal arguments

Unlike tableau and resolution, not suited for computer automation.

- Not based on CNF or DNF

Nested subordinate proofs ('lemmas') in which we derive conclusions from certain assumptions then discharge the assumptions to produce assumption free results

- 

## Rules

### Implication Rule

- If one can redive Y from X, as an assumption, then one can discharge the assumption and conclude that $X\rightarrow Y$ holds unconditionally

![image-20220208132657593](C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220208132657593.png)

- Subordinate proof/lemmas are contained in boxes,
- The first formula X is an assumption
- Anything can be assumed, but not all useful from those assumptions

### Modus Ponens Rule

From $X$ and $X\rightarrow Y$ we can colcude $Y$

![image-20220208132823926](C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220208132823926.png)

A formula is called active at some stage if it does not occur in a closed box 

- At any stage, only active formulas may be used
- Rules are paired, one for introducing, and one for eliminating



![image-20220208133000822](C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220208133000822.png)



### Notes

Primary connective rules come in two flavors: Introduction + Elimination Last two negation rules embody the principle of proof by contradiction Second constant rule has no premises Order of premises does not matter, but all premises must be active. 

## Derived Rules

A rule is redived if it does not strengthen the proof system

- Any occurrence of the rule can be translated away using the official rules

<img src="C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220208134651891.png" alt="image-20220208134651891" style="zoom:33%;" />







## Proof Strategies

- What rules could be applied in the last step
- Based on that, come up with assumptions that should be made to apply those rules
- In proving $X$ assume $|¬X$ and produce  $\bot$ then use negation rule 

## Proving 	Consequences

Want to prove $S\models X$

- S instorudction rule for natural deduction. At any stage, any member of  S may be used as a line
  - WLOG may introduce as the initial lines of the proof, called premesis (no BOXES)
  - Write $S\vdash_d X$ is there is a natural derivation of X from S

![image-20220208135050504](C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220208135050504.png)



# Satisfiability

## Linear time algorithm for 2-SAT

- $u\or v\equiv ¬u\rightarrow v \equiv ¬v\rightarrow u$

Capture this implication information of a 2 CNF F in a diggraph $D=D(F)$

- Vertex set $V(D):=V\cup\overline V$ - all variables $V=V(F)$ and their negation

- Edge setL

  $E(D):=\set{(¬u,v).(¬v,u)|[u\or v]\in F \cup} \set{(¬u.u)|[u]\in F}$

2-clauses lead to two directed edges, whereas a unit clause leads to a single directed edge

### Lemma:

$F$ is not satisfiable iff there is a variable $x\in V:x\rightsquigarrow ¬x \rightsquigarrow x$ 

With this result, sat can be reduced to computing the strngly connected components of the graph D

- The strongle connected components in a graph can be computed in linear time in the size of the graph

**Proof**

Let $F'$ denote the CNF obtained from $F$ by exhaustively applying the resolution rule

- Consider the resolvent [u,v] of [x,u] and [¬x,v]. This resolvent adds two edges. $¬u\rightarrow v$ $¬v \rightarrow u$. But the edges $¬u\rightarrow x \rightarrow v$ and $¬v\rightarrow x \rightarrow u$ were already present So adding them does not alter the relation
- $F$ is not satisfiable $\Longleftrightarrow$ 
- $[]$ appears in $F'\Longleftrightarrow$ 
- $[x],[¬x]$ appears in $F'$ for some variable $x\in V \Longleftrightarrow$ 
- $x\rightarrow ¬x \rightarrow x\in D(F')\Longleftrightarrow x\rightsquigarrow ¬x \rightsquigarrow x\in D(F)$ 



## 3 SAT

- Want to use 2 sat algorithm for solving 3 SAT more efficiently
- Given a 3 CNF over n variables, A subset G of clauses is called independent if no two clauses share any variables.Consider a subset maximal if no further clauses can be added without violation of independence

### Lemma

Consider a maximal set G of independent 3-clauses in F. Then we have:

- $|G|\leq n/3$
- For any truth assignment $\alpha$ to the variables in G, $F^{|\alpha|}$ is a 2 CNF. $F^{|\alpha|}$  is the formula obtained from F by setting all variables defined by α to true or false (remove clauses with true literals and remove false literals from clauses).
- The number of truth assignments satisfying G is $7^{|G|}\leq 7^{n/3}$

### Algorithm

Go through all truth assignments $\alpha$ satisfying $G$ and check the satisfiability of the 2 CNF $F^{|\alpha|}$ in polynomial

- Running time of:
  - $O(7^{n/3}$ $poly$ $(n))=O(1.913^n)$

## Cocke Younger Kasami CYK bottom up parsing algorithm for CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form

If every production has one of the following shapes

- $S\rightarrow \varepsilon$
- $A\rightarrow x(x\in \Sigma $ is a terminal $)$
- $A\rightarrow BC(B,C\in V$ where $B,C\neq S)$







### Algorithm

- Suppose the input string is $y1,...,y6$

<img src="C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220218161756719.png" alt="image-20220218161756719" style="zoom:33%;" />

- Try and find out all variables which can generate up to that cell
- Look at the substring of the input string of length $i$ an index $j$



<img src="C:\Users\leonc\Documents\Warwick\CSY2\modulenotes\CS262.assets\image-20220218163934141.png" alt="image-20220218163934141" style="zoom:33%;" />



- At each time, you calculate if you can calculate the substring of that length
- Anywhere where the start variable is not, look at where things can be made based on the things below
- For [4,2].
  - A can create a, then nothing can create abb
  - X can create aab, then B can create the last B
  - This leaves us with XB,
  - Then S,T fulfil this

### Pseudocode

$LHS(a)= \{ J\in V|G$ has a rule $J\rightarrow a\}$

$LHS(P\cross Q)=\{J\in V| G$ has a rule $J\rightarrow XY$ where $X\in P$ and $Y\in Q \}$

- For $i=1,2,...,l-1$
  - For $j = 1,...,l-(i-1)$
    - For $p = 1,...,i-1$
      - $M[i,j]=M[i,j]\cup LHS(M[p,j]\cross M[i-p,j+p])$ 

If the string has length $n$ the number of rules are $l$, giving a running time of $O(l\cdot n^3)$
